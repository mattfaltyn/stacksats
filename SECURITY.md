Security fixes are prioritized for the current development line on `main` and the latest published release on PyPI.

| Version line | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Latest release | Yes |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately using one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):
   - Go to the repository Security tab and create a private advisory.
2. Email:
   - `maintainers@stackingsats.org`

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept details.
- Any known affected versions.

## Response targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 3 business days.
- Status update: within 7 business days.
- Remediation timeline: communicated based on severity and complexity.

## Disclosure guidance

- Please allow maintainers time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- Once fixed, we will document the change in `CHANGELOG.md` and release notes.
