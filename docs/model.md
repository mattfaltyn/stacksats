## Overview

The model computes daily investment weights that determine how much of your DCA budget to allocate on each day within a given investment window. Unlike uniform DCA (equal daily amounts), this model dynamically adjusts weights based on:

1. **MVRV Z-score**: Buy more when undervalued (low MVRV), less when overvalued
2. **Price vs 200-day MA**: Buy more when price is below long-term trend
3. **4-year Halving Cycle Percentile**: Context from Bitcoin's halving cycle
4. **MVRV Momentum**: Acceleration/deceleration of MVRV trends
5. **Signal Confidence**: Amplify signals when multiple indicators agree
6. **Volatility Dampening**: Reduce exposure during high uncertainty periods

**Key Properties:**
- Weights sum to exactly 1.0 for each date range (within tolerance)
- Past weights are **locked** once computed and never change
- Future weights are distributed from the remaining budget
- Weights are deterministic given the same inputs

For a window of `n` days, the weight for day `i` is computed as:

```
weight[i] = allocate_sequential_stable(base[i] × dynamic[i])
```

Where:
- `base[i]` = 1/n (uniform base distribution)
- `dynamic[i]` = exp(combined_signal × DYNAMIC_STRENGTH)

## Signal Composition

The model combines three primary signals with two modulation factors:

### Primary Signals (Weighted Combination)

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| MVRV Value Signal | 70% | Low MVRV Z-score → buy more, with asymmetric extreme boost |
| MA Signal | 20% | Below 200-day MA → buy more, with adaptive trend modulation |
| Percentile Signal | 10% | 4-year percentile context from halving cycle |

### Signal Modifiers

| Modifier | Effect | Trigger |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Acceleration | ×[0.85, 1.15] | Momentum building/reversing |
| Confidence Boost | ×[1.0, 1.15] | Only when confidence > 0.7 |
| Volatility Dampening | ×[0.8, 1.0] | Only when volatility > 80th percentile |

## Feature Construction

### 200-Day Simple Moving Average

```python
price_ma200 = price.rolling(200, min_periods=100).mean()
price_vs_ma = (price / price_ma200) - 1  # Clipped to [-1, 1]
```

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| `price_vs_ma > 0` | Price above 200-day MA (bullish) |
| `price_vs_ma < 0` | Price below 200-day MA (bearish) |
| `price_vs_ma = 0` | Price at 200-day MA |

### MVRV Z-Score

The MVRV Z-score normalizes the MVRV ratio using a 365-day rolling window:

```python
mvrv_zscore = (mvrv - rolling_mean(365)) / rolling_std(365)
# Clipped to [-4, 4]
```

| Z-Score | Zone | Interpretation |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Z < -2.0 | Deep Value | Historically rare buying opportunity |
| -2.0 ≤ Z < -1.0 | Value | Undervalued, increase buying |
| -1.0 ≤ Z < 1.5 | Neutral | Fair value, normal DCA |
| 1.5 ≤ Z < 2.5 | Caution | Overvalued, reduce buying |
| Z ≥ 2.5 | Danger | Extreme overvaluation, minimize buying |

### MVRV Gradient

The gradient detects MVRV trend direction over a 30-day window with EMA smoothing:

```python
gradient_raw = mvrv_zscore.diff(30)
mvrv_gradient = tanh(gradient_raw.ewm(span=30).mean() * 2)
# Result in [-1, 1]
```

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| `> 0` | MVRV rising (moving toward overvaluation) |
| `< 0` | MVRV falling (moving toward undervaluation) |
| `≈ 0` | Neutral/stable |

### 4-Year Rolling Percentile

Captures Bitcoin's halving cycle context:

```python
mvrv_percentile = rolling_percentile(mvrv, window=1461)  # ~4 years
# Result in [0, 1]
```

| Percentile | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| < 0.25 | Bottom 25% of 4-year range (strong buy) |
| 0.25-0.75 | Middle range (neutral) |
| > 0.75 | Top 25% of 4-year range (reduce buying) |

### MVRV Acceleration

Second derivative for momentum detection:

```python
accel_raw = mvrv_gradient.diff(14)
mvrv_acceleration = tanh(accel_raw.ewm(span=14).mean() * 3)
# Result in [-1, 1]
```

### MVRV Volatility

Rolling volatility for uncertainty detection:

```python
mvrv_volatility = percentile_rank(mvrv_zscore.rolling(90).std())
# Result in [0, 1] where 1 = high volatility
```

### Signal Confidence

Measures agreement between signals:

```python
# When Z-score, percentile, and MA signals agree → confidence ≈ 1
# When signals disagree → confidence ≈ 0
signal_confidence = agreement * 0.7 + gradient_alignment * 0.3
```

### Look-Ahead Bias Prevention

All features are **lagged by 1 day** to prevent information leakage:

```python
features = features.shift(1).fillna(defaults)
```

This ensures the weight for day `t` only uses information available up to day `t-1`.

## Dynamic Multiplier Computation

### Asymmetric Extreme Boost

Bitcoin's MVRV is asymmetric - extreme lows are rare opportunities, while extreme highs often precede corrections:

```python
def compute_asymmetric_extreme_boost(mvrv_zscore):
    # Deep value (Z < -2): Strong positive boost
    # Quadratic: 0.8 * (Z + 2)² + 0.5
    
    # Value zone (-2 ≤ Z < -1): Linear positive boost
    # -0.5 * Z
    
    # Neutral (-1 ≤ Z < 1.5): No boost
    # 0
    
    # Caution (1.5 ≤ Z < 2.5): Moderate negative boost
    # -0.3 * (Z - 1.5)
    
    # Danger (Z ≥ 2.5): Strong negative boost
    # Quadratic: -0.5 * (Z - 2.5)² - 0.3
```

### Adaptive Trend Modifier

Thresholds adapt based on current MVRV level:

```python
def compute_adaptive_trend_modifier(mvrv_gradient, mvrv_zscore):
    # In value zone (Z < -1): Low threshold (0.1) - more sensitive
    # In danger zone (Z > 1.5): High threshold (0.4) - require confirmation
    # Neutral: Standard threshold (0.2)
    
    # Bull (gradient > threshold): up to 1.5x multiplier
    # Bear (gradient < -threshold): down to 0.3x multiplier
```

### Final Multiplier

```python
def compute_dynamic_multiplier(...):
    # 1. Value signal with asymmetric boost
    value_signal = -mvrv_zscore + extreme_boost
    
    # 2. MA signal with adaptive trend modulation
    ma_signal = -price_vs_ma * trend_modifier
    
    # 3. Percentile signal (non-linear emphasis on extremes)
    pct_signal = sign(0.5 - percentile) * |2 * (0.5 - percentile)|^1.5
    
    # 4. Combine with weights
    combined = value_signal * 0.70 + ma_signal * 0.20 + pct_signal * 0.10
    
    # 5. Apply modifiers
    combined *= acceleration_modifier  # [0.85, 1.15]
    combined *= confidence_boost       # [1.0, 1.15] only if confidence > 0.7
    combined *= volatility_dampening   # [0.8, 1.0] only if volatility > 0.8
    
    # 6. Scale and exponentiate
    adjustment = clip(combined * DYNAMIC_STRENGTH, -5, 100)
    return exp(adjustment)
```

## Sequential Allocation

The `allocate_sequential_stable` function ensures all constraints are met:

```python
def allocate_sequential_stable(raw, n_past, locked_weights=None):
    n_total = len(raw)
    base_weight = 1.0 / n_total
    
    # Past days: use signal-based weights
    for i in range(n_past):
        signal = compute_stable_signal_weights(raw[:i+1])[-1]
        w[i] = signal * base_weight
    
    # Future days: uniform distribution
    w[n_past:] = base_weight
    
    # Last day absorbs remainder to ensure sum = 1.0
    w[-1] = 1.0 - sum(w[:-1])
    
    return w
```

## Weight Computation Functions

### compute_weights_fast

Core weight computation for a date range using all enhanced features:

```python
def compute_weights_fast(features_df, start_date, end_date) -> pd.Series:
    # Extract all features: price_vs_ma, mvrv_zscore, mvrv_gradient,
    #   mvrv_percentile, mvrv_acceleration, mvrv_volatility, signal_confidence
    # Compute uniform base PDF
    # Apply dynamic multiplier with all signal layers
    # Return allocated weights
```

### compute_window_weights

Wrapper that handles the past/future weight split for production use:

```python
def compute_window_weights(features_df, start_date, end_date, current_date) -> pd.Series:
    # 1. Extend features with placeholders for future dates
    # 2. Compute FULL range weights
    # 3. Split at current_date boundary:
    #    - Past/current dates: signal-based weights (LOCKED)
    #    - Future dates: uniform weights for remaining budget
    # 4. Return combined weights summing to 1.0
```

**Key Invariant**: As `current_date` advances, more weights get locked in and the remaining budget for future dates decreases.

## Unit Testing

Core mathematical and logical components are verified by unit tests in `tests/test_model_development_helpers.py`:

- **Softmax Stability**: Ensuring probabilities sum to 1.0 and remain stable with very large input values.
- **Z-Score Normalization**: Verifying rolling window mean/std centering.
- **Rolling Percentile**: Correctness of the 4-year halving cycle context computation.
- **MVRV Zone Classification**: Validating the discrete mapping of Z-scores to investment regimes (Value, Neutral, Caution, etc.).
- **Signal Confidence**: Testing the weighted agreement logic between MVRV and MA signals.

Run model-specific tests via:
```bash
pytest tests/test_model_development_helpers.py tests/test_model_development.py -v
```

## Data Requirements

The model requires the following columns from the CoinMetrics BTC data:

| Column | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `PriceUSD_coinmetrics` | Daily BTC price in USD | Yes |
| `CapMVRVCur` | Market Value to Realized Value ratio | Optional* |

*If MVRV data is not available, the model falls back to neutral signals (no dynamic adjustment).
